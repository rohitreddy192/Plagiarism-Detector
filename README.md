# PLAGIARISM DETECTOR 

### Introduction

Plagiarism is defined as the act of taking or attempting to use another personâ€™s works, without referencing him as the owner of his work. It may include direct copy and paste, modification or changing some words of the original information from the internet books, magazine, newspaper, research, journal, personal information or ideas. Tools designed to deal with plagiarism act on the text and ignore images. A part of information transfer are images that transfer the large volume of information. With our plagiarism detector, we strive to spread awareness of text and as well as image plagiarism while letting people know how they can prevent it.

### EXISTING SYSTEM 
1. Designed tools to deal with plagiarism act on the text and ignore images. 
2. On the other, images are inseparable part of information presentation that transfers the large volume of information in an article or scientific research

### Disadvantages of Existing System:
1. Less accuracy.	
2. More time taking process.

### PROPOSED SYSTEM

To overcome the drawbacks of the existing system, the proposed system has been introduced.
This project aims to detect plagiarized images and text files by selectively employing analysis methods depending on their suitability for the input image, using a flexible procedure to determine suspicious image similarities.

### Advantages of Proposed System: 
1. More accuracy.
2. Less time taking process.


### Software Requirements:
1. Python (Version 3.6 or above)
2. Django (Version 1.11 or above)
3. Operating System: Windows (Version 8 or above)
4. Designing: HTML, CSS, Javascript
5. Database: MySQL
6. XAMPP (Version 7.4.29 or above)
7. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

### System Implementation:
##### Modules:
    1. **User Login:** User Signup process is completed within this module and clicks on "Login" so that user can login.
    2.** Upload Source Files:** This module is used to upload source files and it loads all files from corpus folder.
    3. **Upload Suspicious Files:** Upload Suspicious files to load suspicious file.
    4.** Upload Source Image:** Upload source images module to upload all images from "images" folder and all database images histogram will be calculated and store in array and whenever we upload new test image then both histogram will be matched.

### Future Scope:
    This can be further improvised to detect the plagiarism in the following fields:-
    1. Music Field.
    2. Art.
    3. Code Files.
