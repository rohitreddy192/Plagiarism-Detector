# PLAGIARISM DETECTOR 
  A SCALABLE SYSTEM FOR IDENTIFYING SIMILARITY OF TEXT AND IMAGE DATA FROM DOCUMENTS USING Deep Learning.

## Plagiarism - Introduction

Plagiarism is defined as the act of taking or attempting to use another personâ€™s works, without referencing him as the owner of his work. It may include direct copy and paste, modification or changing some words of the original information from the internet books, magazine, newspaper, research, journal, personal information or ideas. Tools designed to deal with plagiarism act on the text and ignore images. A part of information transfer are images that transfer the large volume of information. With our plagiarism detector, we strive to spread awareness of text and as well as image plagiarism while letting people know how they can prevent it.

### EXISTING SYSTEM 

1. Designed tools to deal with plagiarism act on the text and ignore images. 
2. On the other, images are inseparable part of information presentation that transfers the large volume of information in an article or scientific research

### Disadvantages of Existing System:
1. Less accuracy.	
2. More time taking process.

### PROPOSED SYSTEM

To overcome the drawbacks of the existing system, the proposed system has been introduced.
This project aims to detect plagiarized images and text files by selectively employing analysis methods depending on their suitability for the input image, using a flexible procedure to determine suspicious image similarities.

### Advantages of Proposed System: 

1.More accuracy.
2.Less time taking process.


## Software Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Django
3. XAMPP
4. NLTK, OpenCV
5. MySQL
6. VS Code
